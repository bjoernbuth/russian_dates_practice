# Russian dates practice

I still find it quite difficult to quickly 
understand dates in russian in spoken language. 

I guess I'm not the only one. 

This is a very simple website that uses 
hmtl, javascript and text to speech 
to practice. 

I'll sure it with my classmates and 
hope it'll help them too.

JavaScript is not my main language and my JavaScript 
skills are quite limited. This is basically 
translated from python scripts I created, the 
obvious advange being it is easier to show 
my classmates from the russian courses the result
without them having to use python.
