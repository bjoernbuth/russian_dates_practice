# Russian dates practice

I still find it quite difficult to quickly 
understand dates in russian in spoken language. 

I guess I'm not the only one. 

This is a very simple website that uses 
hmtl, javascript and text to speech 
to practice. 

I'll share it with my classmates and 
hope it'll help them too.

JavaScript is not my main language and my JavaScript 
skills are quite limited. This is basically 
translated from python scripts I created, the 
obvious advange being it is easier to show 
my classmates from the russian courses the result
without them having to use python. 

# TODOs - short term
- fix the range of days: currently only 1-28 are generated
  for ease of implementation (February...)
- create a way to adjust the speed of the speech 
- create input fields for customs date ranges (first for years,
  maybe later for months (but don't get to playfull with this,
  focus on useful things)


# TODOs - long term
- practice some Django, Flask or whatever is usefull to 
  get this running with python. 
  ONLY IF there there are clear advantages for using 
  python make this a toy project and host it somewhere 
  (more in order to practice future use cases than because
  it is neccessary here). Evaluate ways and prices 
  how this could be hosted when using python,
