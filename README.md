# russian_dates_practice

I still find it quite difficult to quickly 
understand dates in russian in spoken language. 

I guess I'm not the only one. 

This is a very simple website that uses 
hmtl, javascript and text to speech 
to practice. 

I'll sure it with my classmates and 
hope it'll help them too.
